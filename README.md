Kanda is a lightweight, cost-efficient learning platform designed for hands-on technical training and assessment. It enables users to create, share, and practice Linux-based scenarios in a browser-based terminal environment.

Check out [Kanda.sh](https://kanda.sh) now!

## What is Kanda?

From a user perspective, Kanda provides an interactive "playground" where you can test your problem-solving skills or demonstrate technical proficiency. Unlike traditional cloud-based learning environments that require spinning up heavy virtual machines or containers, Kanda uses a **Linux Emulation Engine** with the hopes of making learning handson more accessible as well as more affordable to operate.

### Our Intentions

*   **Accessibility**: Provide a low-barrier way for anyone to practice system administration, devops, and security fundamentals.
*   **Efficiency**: Eliminate the "spin-up" time and high costs associated with remote VMs.
*   **Assessment**: Offer a platform for companies and educators to asynchronously evaluate technical skills through realistic scenarios.
*   **Community-Driven**: Empower users to build and share their own learning contexts.

### How it Works

1.  **Selection**: Choose a scenario (Context) from our library or generate one using AI suggestions ( you can also manually create a scenario).
2.  **Interaction**: Use a fully functional, browser-based terminal to complete specific tasks.
3.  **Emulation**: Behind the scenes, Kanda manages an emulated filesystem and shell environment, ensuring a responsive and secure experience without the overhead of full virtualization. While the command set is not exhaustive, it is sufficient for most common system administration, devops, and security tasks. More features are being added regularly.
4.  **Feedback**: Upon completion, the AI Reviewer analyzes your history and provides structured feedback on your performance.
