## What's New

- Fixed active sessions not rendering on the dashboard
- Fixed a bug where you could invite non-existent users to sessions
- Enabled Contact page
- Added link to community.kanda.sh - where the release notes are published. 
- Updated an internally published npm module to reference it from GH Packages - with much frustration
- Automated the release process for primary microservices to build and publish docker images in preperation for transition to more stable and cost effective infrastructure
## Known Issues
- Known issues with static site generation and authentication. The plan is to eventually refactor the client to use a different approach since the client was built in pieces over a year. The public parts of the website will remain SSR and anything that requires authentication will be refactored to use dynamic rendering - Stay Tuned!
- When a user first signs in some of the links do automatic redirects. This is because the session cookie isn't syncing as the the primary page is cached. A refresh does fix this and the issue is being tracked and debugged.
- many !
